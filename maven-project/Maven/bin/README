This projected was made by me from a scratch. I've used Maven/Java/Selenium Webdriver stack.
I've implemented this auto test using Cucumber - advanced frame for automation.
Cucumber, as for me, is the best frame for implementation BDD  - it gives an opportunity for everyone to create and maintain tests.
What about Java part - I've tried to use most simple and clear solutions, and tried to avoid complicated ones.
